## 1. Executive Summary

Gardners Ground Maintenance is a Cornwall-based grounds maintenance and gardening services business operating from Roche (PL26 8HN), serving residential and light commercial customers across mid and east Cornwall. The business is operated by Christopher Gardner, a hands-on gardener with **over 10 years of practical experience**, supported by his wife who manages all administration, booking, scheduling, customer communications, and financial oversight.

**Current Position (July 2025):**
- Starting from a **complete shoestring budget** — minimal cash reserves
- Own basic gardening equipment (mowers, strimmers, hedge trimmers, hand tools)
- **No business vehicle yet** — using personal transport / borrowing arrangements
- **No public liability insurance yet** — this is the #1 priority investment
- Fully functional professional website with online booking, payments (Stripe), customer portal, and automated email lifecycle
- Google Apps Script backend handling all booking logic, invoicing, and notifications
- Telegram bot integration for real-time job alerts and daily planning

The business model centres on **recurring subscription-based grounds maintenance** supplemented by one-off specialist jobs. The husband-and-wife team structure keeps overheads extremely low while the technology stack (built in-house at zero cost) provides a level of professionalism typically only seen in much larger operations.

**Key Financial Targets:**
- Year 1: £18,000–£24,000 turnover (building client base)
- Year 2: £30,000–£38,000 turnover (steady recurring clients)
- Year 3: £42,000–£52,000 turnover (full schedule, subscription income)
- Year 4: £55,000–£65,000 turnover (potential part-time helper)
- Year 5: £65,000–£80,000 turnover (established brand, possible second operative)

## 2. Business Overview

### Legal Structure
Sole trader — Christopher Gardner trading as "Gardners Ground Maintenance." HMRC self-assessment registration required. VAT registration threshold (currently £90,000) is unlikely to be reached in Years 1-3, keeping us VAT-exempt and pricing competitive.

### What We Do
We provide professional grounds maintenance and gardening services to domestic homeowners and small commercial properties across Cornwall. Our 11 core services cover the full spectrum of garden care, from routine lawn cutting to emergency tree surgery.

### The Team
| Role | Person | Responsibilities |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Operative / Owner | Chris Gardner | All physical garden work, client site assessments, equipment maintenance |
| Admin / Business Manager | Wife | Bookings, scheduling, invoicing, customer emails, social media, accounts, supplier liaison |

This husband-and-wife model is the backbone of the business. Chris focuses entirely on delivering excellent work on-site while admin handles everything else. This division maximises billable hours and ensures no job or customer falls through the cracks.

### Technology Stack (Built In-House — £0 Cost)
The business operates a custom-built technology platform that would cost £200-400/month if purchased as SaaS:
- **Professional website** (GitHub Pages — free hosting) with online booking
- **Google Apps Script backend** — handles booking logic, calendar management, email automation, invoicing
- **Google Sheets database** — customer records, job history, financial tracking
- **Stripe integration** — online payments, deposits, invoicing
- **Automated email lifecycle** — confirmation, reminders, completion, review requests, seasonal re-engagement
- **Customer self-service portal** — magic-link authentication, job history, rebooking
- **AI-powered chatbot** — 24/7 customer enquiries, service recommendations, instant quotes
- **Telegram bot** — real-time job notifications, daily planner, urgent alerts
- **Dynamic pricing engine** — seasonal adjustments, distance surcharges, emergency premiums
- **Manager dashboard** — PIN-protected financial overview, job management
- **Newsletter system** — customer engagement and seasonal promotions

This technology advantage is a genuine competitive moat. No other sole-trader gardener in Cornwall has this level of digital infrastructure.

- **Key demographics:** Significant retired/semi-retired population, second-home owners, holiday let properties, growing remote-worker population
- **Tourism:** ~4.5 million visitors annually, supporting a large holiday let market

### Addressable Market — Our Service Area

**Primary Service Area (0-15 miles from Roche):**

- Estimated households: ~45,000
- Estimated households needing garden maintenance: ~18,000 (40%)

**Secondary Service Area (15-25 miles, with distance surcharge):**
- Truro, Newquay, Liskeard, Launceston, Falmouth
- Adds an estimated ~30,000 addressable households
- Distance surcharge (£0.50/mile over 15 miles) ensures profitability

### Market Size Estimation
| Segment | Households | Avg Annual Spend | Market Value |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Regular lawn maintenance | 5,400 | £480/year | £2,592,000 |

Even capturing just **0.5% of this market in Year 1** would generate £26,460 — well within our targets.

### Market Trends Favouring Our Business

2. **Remote workers** — Post-COVID influx of professionals who want neat gardens but lack time

2. **Travel distances** — Rural county means more driving between jobs (mitigated by route clustering)
3. **Weather** — More rain days per year vs. national average (need weather contingency planning)
4. **Lower average wages** — Cornwall wages are ~80% of national average, requiring competitive pricing
5. **Fuel costs** — Above-average fuel prices in Cornwall (nearest motorway: M5, 70+ miles away)

## 8. Competitive Analysis

### Direct Competitors (Mid-Cornwall)

| Competitor Type | Number (Est.) | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Solo gardeners (informal) | 50-100 | Low prices, local knowledge | Unreliable, no website, cash only, no insurance |
| Established sole traders | 15-25 | Reputation, client base | Limited online presence, no booking system, slow to respond |
| Small gardening companies (2-5 staff) | 5-10 | Capacity, range of services | Higher prices, less personal, corporate feel |
| National franchises (e.g., Countrywide, Jim's Mowing — limited in Cornwall) | 1-2 | Brand, training, systems | Very high prices, not local, franchise fees push up costs |
| Landscape architects/designers | 5-10 | Design expertise, larger projects | Don't do maintenance, premium pricing |

### Our Competitive Advantages
1. **Technology** — No competitor in our area has online booking, automated emails, Stripe payments, customer portal, or AI chatbot. This is a genuine differentiator.
2. **Communication** — Automated confirmation and reminder emails, real-time Telegram alerts, and responsive admin mean we never miss a beat.
3. **Reliability** — With scheduling technology and a dedicated admin person tracking everything, we're far less likely to forget jobs or double-book.
4. **Price-to-quality ratio** — Professional service and presentation at sole-trader prices.
5. **Subscription model** — Predictable pricing for customers, predictable income for us.
6. **Emergency availability** — Emergency tree surgery with out-of-hours capability.
7. **Personal touch** — Small enough to know customers by name, big enough to deliver professionally.

### Competitive Positioning
We position ourselves as: **"The professionalism of a company, the personal touch of a local gardener, at honest prices."**

We are NOT the cheapest. We are NOT the most expensive. We are the most **reliable and professional** at our price point.

## 9. SWOT Analysis

### Strengths
- ✅ 10+ years practical gardening experience
- ✅ Husband-wife team — dedicated admin keeps overheads low and customer service high
- ✅ Custom-built technology platform (website, booking, payments, CRM, email automation)
- ✅ Own core equipment (no hire costs for everyday jobs)
- ✅ Low fixed overheads (home-based, no premises rent)
- ✅ Flexible — can adapt services, pricing, and schedule quickly
- ✅ Local knowledge — born and raised in Cornwall
- ✅ Wide service range (11 services + bespoke capabilities)

### Weaknesses
- ❌ **No public liability insurance yet** — CRITICAL gap, limits marketable work
- ❌ **No dedicated business vehicle** — limits equipment transport and range
- ❌ **No cash reserves** — cannot absorb equipment breakdowns or quiet months
- ❌ **Single operative** — Chris being ill or injured stops all revenue
- ❌ **No formal qualifications** — no NPTC chainsaw certificate, no PA1/PA6 spraying certificates
- ❌ **No established reputation** — new business, no Google reviews yet
- ❌ **Limited marketing budget** — relying on free/organic channels initially

### Opportunities
- 🔵 Cornwall's ageing population creates growing demand for garden help
- 🔵 Holiday let market growing — reliable maintenance providers in high demand
- 🔵 Few competitors have any digital presence — easy to dominate online locally
- 🔵 Subscription model creates predictable recurring revenue
- 🔵 Partnership opportunities with letting agents, estate agents, care providers
- 🔵 Seasonal upselling — existing lawn customers can be sold scarifying, treatments, clearances
- 🔵 Referral programme — built into website already
- 🔵 Content marketing via blog — SEO for "gardener near me" type searches
- 🔵 Cornwall Council contracts for small-scale parish/community maintenance

### Threats
- 🔴 Weather dependency — prolonged wet spells eliminate revenue with no sick pay
- 🔴 Fuel price increases — Cornwall is a high-fuel-use county due to distances
- 🔴 Equipment breakdown — mower or strimmer failure halts work
- 🔴 Health/injury — single-point-of-failure with one operative
- 🔴 Seasonal cashflow — January-March can be very lean
- 🔴 Competitor reaction — established gardeners may undercut if we take their clients
- 🔴 Cost of living pressures — customers may cut discretionary spending
- 🔴 Insurance/regulation costs rising annually

### 5-Year Financial Summary

| Year | Revenue | Expenses | Net Profit | Monthly Take-Home | Recurring % |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | £15,750 | £4,900 | £10,850 | £904 | 25% |
| 2 | £28,800 | £10,030 | £18,770 | £1,564 | 40% |
| 3 | £42,750 | £13,600 | £29,150 | £2,429 | 55% |
| 4 | £53,500 | £23,140 | £30,360 | £2,530 | 60% |
| 5 | £80,000 | £46,220 | £33,780 | £2,815 | 65% |
| **5-Year Total** | **£220,800** | **£97,890** | **£122,910** | | |

### Tax Considerations
- **Personal allowance:** £12,570 (no income tax)
- **Year 1-2:** Likely within personal allowance — minimal or no income tax
- **Year 3+:** Tax on profits above £12,570 at 20% basic rate, NI Class 2 (£3.45/week) + Class 4 (9% on profits £12,570-£50,270)
- **Year 3 estimated tax:** ~£3,300 (income tax) + ~£1,490 (NI) = ~£4,790
- **Year 5 estimated tax:** ~£4,240 (income tax) + ~£1,910 (NI) = ~£6,150

After-tax take-home Year 5: ~£27,630 = ~£2,303/month

*This is honest Cornwall money. Not London wages, but a sustainable living doing work we love in a beautiful county.*

## 15. Pricing Strategy

### Philosophy
We price at **mid-market for Cornwall** — above the "bloke with a mower" cash-in-hand operators, but below established companies with vans, staff, and overheads. Our technology and professionalism justify a premium over informal operators.

### Pricing Framework
| Service | Our Price | Cash-in-hand competitor | Established company | Our positioning |
|---------|----------|----------------------|--------------------|----|
| Lawn cutting | £40 | £20-£30 | £45-£60 | Mid-market |
| Hedge trimming | £60 | £30-£45 | £65-£90 | Mid-market |
| Garden clearance | £120 | £80-£100 | £150-£250 | Competitive |
| Power washing | £60 | £40-£50 | £80-£120 | Value |

### Dynamic Pricing Elements
1. **Distance surcharge:** £0.50/mile over 15 miles from base — ensures distant jobs are profitable
2. **Emergency premium:** 50% surcharge on emergency tree work outside 8am-6pm
3. **Seasonal adjustments:** Potential discounts in Q1 (quiet period) to maintain cash flow
4. **Subscription discount:** 10% off per-job price for customers on recurring monthly contracts
5. **Referral discount:** 10% off next job for successful referrals

### Price Review Cycle
Annual review every January, considering:
- Fuel cost changes
- Material cost changes
- Local competitor pricing
- Inflation / cost of living
- Customer feedback
- Capacity utilisation (if over-booked, prices should rise)

---

## 16. Growth Strategy

### Year 1-2: Build the Foundation
1. Acquire first 20-30 recurring clients through organic marketing
2. Build Google review count to 20+ (5-star average)
3. Establish reliable weekly/fortnightly route clusters
4. Reinvest all available profit into equipment and vehicle
5. Obtain NPTC chainsaw certificate — unlocks emergency tree surgery properly
6. Build relationships with 3-5 holiday let management companies

### Year 2-3: Deepen and Widen
1. Grow to 35-45 recurring clients
2. Introduce formal subscription packages (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
3. Target commercial contracts (pubs, B&Bs, care homes)
4. Launch paid advertising (Facebook, Google)
5. Obtain PA1/PA6 spraying certificates — professionalises lawn treatment
6. Develop "Garden Health Plan" annual programme (treatment + scarifying + feeding)
7. Build referral network with complementary trades (fencers, landscapers, tree surgeons)

### Year 3-4: Scale Carefully
1. Hire first part-time helper for peak season
2. Second vehicle (if justified by route geography)
3. Consider Checkatrade/Bark membership for lead generation
4. Build portfolio of before/after project photos for marketing
5. Target parish council / community contracts
6. Develop winter service offerings (path gritting? garden lighting? maintenance plans?)

### Year 4-5: Establish and Consolidate
1. Employee on near full-time basis
2. Two-crew capability for larger jobs
3. Brand consolidation — recognised name in mid-Cornwall
4. Evaluate limited company conversion (tax efficiency at ~£40,000+ profit)
5. Consider apprentice / trainee for future growth
6. Long-term commercial contracts (multi-year)

## 19. Exit Strategy / Long-Term Vision

### 5-Year Vision
By June 2030, Gardners Ground Maintenance is:
- A recognised and trusted brand in mid-Cornwall
- Employing 1-2 people beyond the founders
- Generating £65,000-£80,000 annual revenue
- Providing a comfortable family income of £25,000-£30,000 after tax
- Operating 1-2 branded vehicles
- Holding all relevant professional certifications
- Managing 50-70 recurring client accounts

### 10-Year Possibilities
- **Stay Small:** Maintain as a 2-3 person operation providing a comfortable living. Nothing wrong with this — it's the most common and sustainable path.
- **Grow Further:** Build to 5-6 staff, multiple crews, and commercial contracts. Revenue potential: £150,000-£250,000. Would likely require limited company status.
- **Franchise/Licence:** Develop the technology platform and operational model into a franchise model for other sole-trader gardeners. The booking system and automation could be valuable IP.
- **Sell:** A grounds maintenance business with 50+ recurring clients, established brand, and proven systems has tangible sale value (typically 1-2x annual profit = £30,000-£70,000).

### Succession
The technology platform is fully documented and could be operated by anyone. The business's value lies in:
1. The client base and recurring relationships
2. The brand reputation and reviews
3. The technology platform
4. The operational processes

## Document Notes

**Purpose:** This business plan is designed to be uploaded to an AI assistant (Claude) for conversion into a comprehensive, professionally formatted LaTeX PDF document. The structured markdown format with clear headings, tables, and data points facilitates accurate conversion.

**Honesty Statement:** All projections in this document are conservative and based on real Cornwall market conditions. This document does not inflate potential or hide challenges. Year 1 will be financially tight. Growth will be gradual. Cornwall is not a high-wage economy. But with hard work, reliability, and the technology advantage we've built, this business can provide a sustainable and growing income for our family.
